# DeviantArt Downloader

This python script allows you to download all the files found in their DeviantArt RSS feed for a specific DeviantArt username.

## Usage

To run, type in: 

```
python app.py <username>
```
If the script finds files, it will try to save it in a directory called "download".  If a directory does not exist, it will make one.
